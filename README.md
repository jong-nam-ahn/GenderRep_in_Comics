The issue of representation has always persisted in literature. Are men and women portrayed differently in comics? I use multiple classification models to investigate the relationship between gender and character attributes (abilities, power stats, appearance,...). Neural Network Classification is the best performing and least overfitting. The weight of a character is most important in predicting gender, which is somewhat intuitive; however, other features of importance might be worthwhile to consider. Code was written and run in Jupyter Notebook.
