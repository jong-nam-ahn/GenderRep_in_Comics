# Gender Representation in Superhero Comics
SML312 Final Project 23F

I use multiple classification models to investigate the relationship between gender and character attributes (abilities, power stats, appearance,etc). Neural Network Classification is the best performing and least overfitting. The weight of a character is most important in predicting gender, which is somewhat intuitive; however, other features of importance might be worthwhile to consider. Code was written and run in Jupyter Notebook.
